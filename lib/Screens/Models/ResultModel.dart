A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye (the clear part of the eye that helps to focus light).
Cataracts are very common as you get older.
In fact, more than half of all Americans age 80 or older either have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of cataracts. 
""";

const String Csymptom = """
1- Blurred Vision: One of the most noticeable symptoms of cataracts is blurry vision, which can make it difficult to see objects clearly, especially at a distance.

2- Sensitivity to Light: Cataracts can cause increased sensitivity to light, making bright lights, such as headlights or sunlight, uncomfortable or glare-filled.

3- Difficulty with Night Vision: Many people with cataracts experience difficulty seeing clearly in low-light situations, such as at night. This can make driving or navigating in dimly lit areas challenging.

4- Colors appear faded or yellowed: Cataracts can cause a change in color perception, making colors appear less vibrant or faded. Some individuals may also experience a yellowing of their vision.

5- Frequent Changes in Eyeglass Prescription: As cataracts progress, the prescription for glasses or contact lenses may need to be changed frequently, as the clarity of vision fluctuates.

6- Double Vision: Cataracts can lead to double vision, where a person sees two images overlapping or adjacent to each other instead of a single clear image.

7- Difficulty with Reading and Activities: Cataracts can affect daily activities such as reading, watching television, or participating in hobbies that require clear vision.

It's important to note that these symptoms can also be associated with other eye conditions, so it's crucial to consult an eye care professional for a proper diagnosis if you're experiencing any of these signs.
""";

const String CmedicalAdvice = """
1- Blurred or hazy vision: If you notice a persistent blurriness or haziness in your vision that is affecting your daily activities, it's a good idea to consult a doctor.

2- Difficulty with night vision: If you find it increasingly challenging to see clearly in low-light situations or at night, it's important to get your eyes evaluated.

3- Sensitivity to light and glare: If bright lights, such as sunlight or headlights, cause discomfort or excessive glare, it's worth seeking medical advice.

4- Color changes or faded vision: If you notice a change in your color perception or if your vision appears to be dull or faded, it's advisable to get a professional evaluation.

5- Double vision: If you're experiencing double vision, where objects appear doubled or overlapping, it's important to consult an eye care professional.

6- Difficulty with daily activities: If cataract symptoms are interfering with your ability to perform routine tasks like reading, driving, or participating in hobbies, it's time to seek medical advice.

Remember, cataracts are treatable, and early detection can help ensure timely and appropriate management. An eye care professional can assess your symptoms, perform a comprehensive eye examination, and provide guidance on the most suitable treatment options for your specific situation.

    """Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, becomes damaged.
It's usually caused by fluid building up in the front part of the eye, which increases pressure inside the eye.
Glaucoma can lead to loss of vision if it's not diagnosed and treated early.
It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in adults in their 70s and 80s.""";

const String Gsymptom = """
1- Increased intraocular pressure: Glaucoma is often associated with increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure. However, it's important to note that not all cases of glaucoma are characterized by high pressure.

2- Vision loss: Glaucoma typically causes peripheral vision loss initially, which can progress to central vision loss over time. The extent of vision loss can vary from mild to severe.

3- Blurred or hazy vision: People with glaucoma may experience blurred or hazy vision, making it difficult to see objects clearly.

4- Halos around lights: Glaucoma can cause the perception of halos or rainbow-colored rings around lights, particularly in low-light conditions.

5- Eye pain or discomfort: Some individuals with glaucoma may experience eye pain, headaches, or general discomfort in or around the eyes.

6- Redness or swelling: In certain types of glaucoma, such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, there may be redness, swelling, or increased tearing of the eyes.

7- Tunnel vision: As glaucoma progresses, it can lead to tunnel vision, where the individual's field of vision becomes narrow and they lose peripheral vision.

It's important to remember that glaucoma can develop slowly and gradually, and some people may not experience any noticeable symptoms until the disease has progressed significantly. Regular eye exams, especially for individuals at higher risk, are crucial for early detection and treatment of glaucoma. If you suspect you may have glaucoma or are experiencing any changes in your vision, it's best to consult an eye care professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis.
    """;

const String GmedicalAdvice = """
1- Changes in vision: If you notice any changes in your vision, such as blurred vision, difficulty seeing objects clearly, or a loss of peripheral vision, it's important to consult a doctor.

2- Eye pain or discomfort: Persistent eye pain, headaches, or general discomfort in or around the eyes should be evaluated by a medical professional.

3- Family history of glaucoma: If you have a family history of glaucoma, it's important to inform your doctor and have regular eye exams to monitor your eye health.

4- Age and risk factors: As you get older, the risk of developing glaucoma increases. If you are over the age of 40, it's a good idea to have regular eye exams to check for glaucoma, especially if you have other risk factors such as a family history, diabetes, high blood pressure, or certain ethnic backgrounds (African, Hispanic, or Asian descent).

5- Previous eye injuries or surgeries: If you have had any previous eye injuries or surgeries, it's important to inform your doctor and have regular eye exams to monitor for any potential complications or development of glaucoma.

6- Medications and health conditions: Some medications or health conditions may increase the risk of glaucoma. If you are taking medications or have health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or a history of steroid use, it's important to discuss with your doctor and have regular eye exams.

7- Routine eye exams: Even if you do not experience any symptoms or have known risk factors, it's still recommended to have routine eye exams as part of your overall healthcare. Regular eye exams can help detect glaucoma or other eye conditions at an early stage when treatment is more effective.

Remember, early detection and treatment are key to managing glaucoma and preventing vision loss. If you have any concerns about your eye health or are unsure if you should seek medical advice, it's always best to consult with an eye care professional.

    Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels damaging the back of the eye (retina).
    It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated.
    However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight.
    """;
const String Dsymptom = """
1- Blurred or fluctuating vision: Diabetic retinopathy can cause changes in the blood vessels of the retina, leading to vision problems. Blurriness or difficulty focusing on objects may occur.

2- Floaters: These are small specks or spots that seem to float across your field of vision. They are caused by tiny clumps of blood or other debris in the vitreous gel inside the eye.

3- Impaired color vision: Diabetic retinopathy can affect the perception of colors, making them appear washed out or faded.

4- Dark or empty areas in vision: As the disease progresses, damaged blood vessels can cause parts of the visual field to become dark or empty.

5- Difficulty seeing at night: Reduced night vision or an increased sensitivity to glare may occur due to retinal damage.

It's important to note that not everyone with diabetic retinopathy experiences symptoms, especially in the early stages. Regular eye examinations by an ophthalmologist are crucial for detecting and monitoring the condition, especially for individuals with diabetes.

1- Any changes in your vision: If you notice sudden or significant changes in your vision, such as blurred vision, the appearance of floaters, dark areas in your visual field, or difficulty seeing clearly, it is important to consult a healthcare professional.

2- Worsening symptoms: If you already have been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy and notice a progression or worsening of your symptoms, it is essential to seek medical advice. This could include an increase in the number of floaters, a decrease in your ability to see clearly, or an expansion of dark areas in your vision.

3- Eye pain or redness: If you experience eye pain, redness, or any discomfort in your eyes, it may indicate an underlying issue that requires immediate attention.

4- Loss of peripheral vision: If you notice a loss of peripheral vision, where objects or areas to the side become increasingly difficult to see, it could be a sign of advanced diabetic retinopathy or other eye conditions.

5- Suspected eye infection: If you develop symptoms such as eye discharge, itching, irritation, or increased sensitivity to light, it may indicate an eye infection that needs medical attention.

Remember, early detection and treatment are key to managing diabetic retinopathy effectively. If you are unsure or concerned about any changes in your vision or eye health, it is best to consult a healthcare professional promptly.
